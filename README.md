AI GPU Grid: A Scalable NoC Simulator

1. Project Overview

This project provides a Python-based functional simulator for a scalable Network-on-Chip (NoC) designed to interconnect a grid of GPUs. The primary goal is to explore architectural and protocol-level innovations for GPU-to-GPU communication. The simulator is designed to be parameterizable and scalable, allowing for the analysis of key performance metrics like latency and bandwidth under various synthetic workloads.

2. Key Architectural Choices

The simulator implements a set of foundational architectural choices designed for high performance and effective modeling.

    Protocol: AXI/CHI-like packet-based communication. The simulator abstracts high-level memory transactions into packets that are injected into the NoC for transmission.

    Topology: A 2D Mesh. This topology was chosen for its simple, regular structure and ease of scalability. Each router connects to four neighbors (North, East, South, West) and one local processing node (GPU).

    Flow Control: Wormhole Switching with Virtual Channels (VCs). Packets are broken into smaller flits. To improve performance and mitigate Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking, each physical input port is equipped with multiple virtual channels, allowing separate packet flows to bypass each other.

    Routing Algorithm: The simulator supports multiple routing strategies:

        Deterministic XY Routing: A simple, deadlock-free algorithm where packets are routed fully in the X-dimension before being routed in the Y-dimension.

        Adaptive Routing: A dynamic, load-aware algorithm where routers check the buffer occupancy of their neighbors to avoid sending traffic toward congested hotspots, providing a more balanced network load.

3. Project Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure to separate concerns between the NoC components, simulation engine, and analysis tools.

4. Code Implementation Details

noc/router.py

This is the most critical module, containing the logic for a single router. It is designed to be highly flexible.

    VC-aware Buffers: The router's input ports are structured as a list of independent virtual channel buffers (deque objects), allowing for parallel packet flows through a single physical port.

    Dual-Mode Routing: The process_cycle method can operate in one of two modes based on the configuration:

        XY Mode: It uses simple, deterministic XY logic to compute the output port for a flit.

        Adaptive Mode: It computes a set of all productive paths and queries the buffer fullness of the downstream neighbors for each path. It then selects the path leading to the least congested neighbor, dynamically routing around traffic hotspots.

    Fair Arbitration: A round-robin arbiter is used to ensure that all virtual channels get a fair chance to access an output port, preventing starvation.

noc/node.py

This module models the GPU node that generates and consumes traffic.

    Traffic Generation: The _generate_traffic method creates packets based on the configured injection_rate.

    Pattern-based Destinations: A helper method, _get_destination, implements various traffic patterns (uniform_random, transpose, hotspot) by selecting a destination address according to the pattern's logic.

    Packetization: The _packetize method breaks a logical Packet into a sequence of Flits and assigns the entire packet to a single virtual channel for its journey through the network.

5. How to Run the Simulator

    Installation: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
    Bash

pip install PyYAML numpy matplotlib networkx

Configuration: Edit the config.yaml file to set your desired parameters.

    num_gpus: Number of nodes (must be a perfect square).

    traffic_pattern: uniform_random, transpose, or hotspot.

    injection_rate: Probability (0.0 to 1.0) of a node generating a packet each cycle.

    routing_algo: XY or adaptive.

    num_virtual_channels: Number of VCs per port (e.g., 4).

    simulation_cycles: The duration of the simulation.

Execution: Run the main script from your terminal.
Bash

python main.py

Visualization: To generate plots, navigate to the vis directory and run the scripts.
Bash

    cd vis
    python stats_plot.py
    python topology.py

6. Performance Analysis & Results

Performance testing under the stressful transpose traffic pattern clearly demonstrates the value of the architectural improvements.

    Baseline (XY Routing, No VCs): The initial network saturated at a very low injection rate (~0.09 packets/node/cycle). This was caused by severe Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking, where a single stalled packet could block an entire input buffer.

    Improvement with Virtual Channels: Introducing 4 VCs dramatically improved performance. By allowing packets to bypass each other, the network was able to handle a much higher traffic load, pushing the saturation point to an injection rate of ~0.12.

    Final Architecture (VCs + Adaptive Routing): The final architecture provided the best performance. By combining the HoL-blocking mitigation of VCs with the load-balancing capability of adaptive routing, the network's efficiency was maximized. The adaptive algorithm successfully routed traffic around hotspots, further increasing the network's saturation threshold and lowering latency at high loads compared to the VC-only implementation.

7. Future Work

This simulator provides a strong foundation for further research. Potential extensions include:

    Deeper Protocol Modeling: Implement specific CHI messages to model cache coherence traffic.

    New Topologies: Extend the Network class to support other interconnect topologies, such as Torus or Dragonfly.

    Power and Area Modeling: Add simple energy models to estimate power consumption based on router activity (buffer reads/writes, crossbar traversals).

    RTL Implementation: Use the validated architectural principles as a specification for a hardware implementation in Verilog/SystemVerilog.
